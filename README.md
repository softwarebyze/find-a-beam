# find-a-beam
Stop flipping through the AISC Steel Construction manual in search of a beam!

My website uses AISC's [v15.0 Shapes Database](https://www.aisc.org/publications/steel-construction-manual-resources/15th-ed-steel-construction-manual/shapes-database-v15.0/)
and allows the user to search for beams by type, weight, area, and more!
